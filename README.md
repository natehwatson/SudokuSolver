# SudokuSolver
This is a depth-first approach to solve 9x9 sudoku puzzles using a tree. Sudoku grids are read in from sudokus.txt using this format: Each sudoku grid must be ten lines. The first line must include "Grid". Use any ordering conventions you would like. The next nine lines must be nine unseparated digits each. Each line will be the rows, in order, of the sudoku grid. Upon completion, the program will print into the command line the sum of all the three digit numbers in the top left of each grid. (The first three digits of the first row will be read a three digit number) The solved sudoku boards will be printed in the file Answers.txt
